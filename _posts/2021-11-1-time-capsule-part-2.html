<p>Considering the theme of my time capsule, I decided to pay homage to a staple of every Cuban household - a dominoes set.</p>

<p>I created my prototype out of cardboard to see the concept. Ideally, I'd make the final time capsule out of wood, like a real dominoes set.</p>

<p>I made a few sketches and looked at some inspiration photos, and finally settled on a dominoes box with a sliding lid, similar to one my family had.</p>

<p>Working with cardboard was a little tricky, particularly when it came to the adhesive material. I looked at <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-an-Amazing-Sliding-Box-From-Old-Cardbo/?amp_page=true">this guide</a> for making a cardboard box with a sliding lid.</p>

<p>Finally, I decorated the box with colorful artwork to make it look like a real dominoes set.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>For the final time capsule, I'm planning on transfering this design to wood. I will probably make the dimensions smaller, it's a bit tall now. Then, I'll laser cutting the designs onto the panels, and paint them.</p>
