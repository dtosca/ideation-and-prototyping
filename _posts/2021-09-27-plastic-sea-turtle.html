<p>When first thinking of this project, I decided I wanted to make something with the hundreds of plastic bags that I saved in my cupboards. I wanted to see which endangered species are most affected by plastics. After some research, I decided to make a sea turtle out of crocheted plastic bags.</p>

<h1>The Majestic Sea Turtles</h1>
<p>Seven species of sea turtles inhabit our world's oceans, spending most of their lives living in the sea.<sup><a href="https://conserveturtles.org/information-sea-turtles-species-world/">[1]</a></sup> Because of human intervention, most of the species of sea turtles are endangered, where three of the species classified as critically endangered.<sup><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/sea-turtle">[2]</a></sup> The Work Conservation Union has indentifies five dangers to sea turtles:<sup><a href="http://www.bonaireturtles.org/wp/explore/why-are-sea-turtles-endangered/">[3]</a></sup> 
<ul>
  <li>Fisheries due to entanglement and destruction of their habitat.</li>
  <li>Poachers directly taking sea turtles and their eggs.</li>
  <li>Coastal development decimating sea turtle habitats.</li>
  <li>Pollution, especially plastics that are ingested.</li>
  <li>Climate change, which causes severe weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Sea Turtles and Plastic</h1>
<p>As sea turtles reside primarily in the ocean, plastics that end up in the ocean are very harmful to them and their habitat. Microplastics on the beaches can affect their nests and eggs.<sup><a href="https://www.seeturtles.org/sea-turtles-threats">[4]</a></sup> About 52% of sea turtles have injested plastic, which can lead to death.<sup><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-do-sea-turtles-eat-unfortunately-plastic-bags">[5]</a></sup>
They often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, they may get entanglled while swimming, or consume microplastics from food.</p>

<h1>My Plarn Sea Turtle</h1>
<p>I decided to make a sea turtle out of plastic yarn.</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>
<p>I made some rough sketches of what I wanted my sea turtle to look like. I made a second version of the sketch to better reflect what sea turtle fins realistically look like.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>I first had to create the plastic yarn. I searched a few methods, and eventually followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1kg2Z_wCIo"> this tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I modified a sea turtle pattern that used tradition yarn. My pattern can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hFKsXwBZTUsTYyhYuD-B1LaE3LMg4ugCNGA26M3v9nY/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>

<p>This is my construction process:</p>

<h2>Final Product</h2>
<p>After four days of crocheting, here is my final product:</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>I am very proud of the final result! It was a much trickier than I had originally imagined. The plarn was very hard to work with; despite being a material that is not biodegradable, it's surprisingly flimsy. There was no way to undo the loops during contruction. You have to be very delicate when putting the plarn together. Working with the reusable plastic bags was much harder than the single use ones. It was a frustrating, but ultimately rewarding process!</p>
