As inconvenient as wearing a mask might seem to some, I was relieved when it became the norm because it hid all my insecurities. I no longer had to show the world my lips plagued by my anxious lip picking, my [stubble](https://www.uclahealth.org/obgyn/hirsutism), or my double chin that showed the weight I’d gained during lockdown. It’s taken a long time to recognize these insecurities as fatphobic, racist, and ableist, but even then these thoughts persist.

I created a mask that hid my insecurity: a mask that shows the (white) Western ideals of beauty. I googled “pretty face,” revealing a white woman with moisturized lips, chiseled cheekbones, a smooth chin, and a sharp jawline.

I drew this woman on my mask, imagining a world where I could throw a mask on my face and show the world what I think they want to see. I wouldn’t have to disappoint anyone with the reality of my face.

My mask is an illusion and a performance. It’s trying to reach the perfectionism that we are all burdened with. But, ultimately, the illusion isn’t real. 

I’ll have to take off my mask someday. I can only hope by then I’ll see a beauty in my face, flaws and all.
