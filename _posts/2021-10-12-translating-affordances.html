<p>How to translate a virtual water sorting puzzle into the real world.</p>

<h2>Coming up with an Idea</h2>

<p>When first considering this assignment, I immediately turned to mobile games as my source of inspiration. Iâ€™ve always loved silly mobile games, and theyâ€™re rich in affordances!</p>

<p>I considered several apps I already owned - Minesweepers, Candy Crush, PokÃ©mon Go, Toon Blast...</p>

<p>I finally settled on a relaxing game I use before sleeping - a water sort puzzle game.</p>

<h2>Water Sort Puzzle Game</h2>

<p>You start off with test tubes filled with an assortment of colored water. You have to pour the water into different tubes until all the tubes are filled with the same color water.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q3Ur-BNk40">example level.</a></p>

<p>The main affordances the game presents are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Holding the beakers</li>
  <li>Pouring water (while maintaining separate water colors).</li>
  <li>Seeing the different water colors</li>
</ul>  

<p>Itâ€™s a simple interaction in a game, but potentially difficult to replicate in the real world.</p>

<p>Despite itâ€™s simple concept, itâ€™s affordances are not easily translated into the physical world!</p>

<h2>Initial Ideas and Challenges</h2>

<p>I thought first of having colored water with <a href="https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/colorful-sugar-density-tower/">different densities</a> in order to keep the colors separated. My only hesitation was that heavy water would sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>My other idea is to make colorful <a href="http://www.scifun.org/homeexpts/lumpyliquids.htm">non-newtonian fluids</a>, which may be easier to keep separated, but they may also squish together.</p>

<p>I could also create a tube with premade slots to keep the fluids separated.</p>

<p>This may not work at all, but Iâ€™m excited to experiment!</p>

<h2>Attempt #1</h2>

<p>First, I got my materials - some corn starch, water, and food coloring.</p>

<p>Mixing the water and corn starch to the right viscocity wasn't an exact science. The first time I made it, I missed the mark and it was too watery. By the second attempt, I had it correct.</p>

<p>And then, the moment of truth - would it sit nicely on top of each other?</p>

<p>Nope! The two fluids mixed together to make a muddy grey.</p>

<p>Back to the drawing board. ðŸ¤·</p>

<h2>Attempt #2</h2>

<p>I decided to try to make a density tower to simulate this game.</p>

<img src="https://dtosca.github.io/ideation-and-prototyping/assets/translating_affordances/tower.jpg" alt="A density tower." width="400" height="251">

<p>I used corn syrup for the bottom layer, and sugar water for the middle layer, and water for the top layer.</p>

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRF3YEdEgd_gm1RdxNew5uVR9tqTFbIuzfVrgaMA5JvqfDYgAcTL91p5WFoNdIfam6cQkfo3XNr-vpz/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000" frameborder="0" width="480" height="299" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<p>I added the food coloring to each layer and trued pouring the sugar water over the corn syrup.</p>

<p>Success!</p>

<p>But when it came to the top layer, the sugar water was not desnse enough to keep the layers seperated. They ended up mixing. :(</p>

<h2>More trial and error</h2>

<p>I tried a few other methods.</p>

<p>Maybe I could dilue the corn syrup? No, then the pure corn syrup and diluted corn syrup mix together.</p>

<p>What about other fluids? Well, it turns out, other fluids may be the right density, but they don't take to food coloring! Canola oil worked very well as a top layer, but it wouldn't mix with the gel food coloring I had.</p>

<h2>Final attempt - success! (Kind of)</h2>

<p>I decided to concede and stick with the KISS principle - two layers, just water and corn syrup. And it worked! A playable water sort puzzle.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Turns out, you can't defy physics! I could only make this with two layers given my resources. I'm not even sure you could replicate the game with more than three layers. Even with my two layers, it was hard to keep them seperated and pour them out without disturbing the other layers. Sometimes, digital affordances can only stay digital.</p>
