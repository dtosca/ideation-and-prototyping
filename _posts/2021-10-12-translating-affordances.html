<h2>Coming up with an Idea</h2>

<p>When first considering this assignment, I immediately turned to mobile games as my source of inspiration. I’ve always loved silly mobile games, and they’re rich in affordances!</p>

<p>I considered several apps I already owned - Minesweepers, Candy Crush, Pokémon Go, Toon Blast...</p>

<p>I finally settled on a relaxing game I use before sleeping - a water sort puzzle game.</p>

<h2>Water Sort Puzzle Game</h2>

<p>You start off with test tubes filled with an assortment of colored water. You have to pour the water into different tubes until all the tubes are filled with the same color water.</p>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q3Ur-BNk40">example level.</a></p>

<p>The main affordances the game presents are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Holding the beakers</li>
  <li>Pouring water (while maintaining separate water colors).</li>
  <li>Seeing the different water colors</li>
</ul>  

<p>It’s a simple interaction in a game, but potentially difficult to replicate in the real world.</p>

<p>Despite it’s simple concept, it’s affordances are not easily translated into the physical world!</p>

<h2>Initial Ideas and Challenges</h2>

<p>I thought first of having colored water with <a href="https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/colorful-sugar-density-tower/">different densities</a> in order to keep the colors separated. My only hesitation was that heavy water would sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>My other idea is to make colorful <a href="http://www.scifun.org/homeexpts/lumpyliquids.htm">non-newtonian fluids</a>, which may be easier to keep separated, but they may also squish together.</p>

<p>I could also create a tube with premade slots to keep the fluids separated.</p>

<p>This may not work at all, but I’m excited to experiment!</p>
