<p>Reflecting on my time capsule and where it will end up in 100 years...</p>

<p>In the story, my lineage finds the time capsule in a warehouse, collecting dust in a box.</p>

<p>They don't understand the objects or even know what the game of dominoes is.</p>

<p>Thinking about where my lineage will be, I most likely won't have biological children with my wife. We won't have kids with my ethnic background, they may not even learn Spanish. My cultural understanding of this time capsule, of being Cuban-American, ends with me.</p>

<p>At first, this realization made me sad and emotion. This time capsule is (ironically) ephemeral, and that's okay.</p>

<p>The time capsule captures my present moment in time. It's a present object. There's no future that makes sense for this time capsule; it's suspended in the "right now."" It's a recuerdo, a memory, just for me.</p>

<p>The personal, presentness of this capsule is the true beauty it holds.</p>
