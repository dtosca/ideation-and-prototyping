<p>Recuerdos from a Cuban-American's journey to finding their identity en una tierra extranjera, to be put in a time capsule.</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>

  <li><b>Manilla de cuba</b></li>
  <br>

  <p>I got this bracelet when I was young as a gift from my abuelita when she returned from a trip to Cuba. I didn’t think much of this bracelet, I left it in a jewelry box that ended up coming with me to Wellesley College. I didn’t think much about being Cuban before I left Miami, where my latinidad was as natural as breathing air. Leaving that bubble and going to the (white) institution at Wellesley, I had to fight for my sense of identity, for the part of myself that I left behind when I went to college. The bracelet was a small comfort, a small piece of home that reminded me of mi herencia y mi familia. It’s turned into a symbol of home.

  <li><b>La velita de Santa Bárbara</b></li>
  <br>

  <p>Whenever I visited my Abuela Cuca’s small townhouse, the biggest thing you’d see in the living room was a four foot tall <a href="https://www.creators.com/read/the-art-of-design/12/15/celebrating-dual-traditions-in-cuba-santa-barabara-and-chango">Santa Bárbara</a> statue. She’s a prominent patron saint in Cuba, also associated with Chango, an orisha deity in Santeria. Even though we were not practicing Catholics, religion’s presence was a fixture in my abuela’s house. My abuelita had little statues of Santa Bárbara and San Lazaro around the house, and a large painting of The Last Supper over the dining room table, and candles of the saints all over the house.</p>

  <p>On December 17, 2017, the night my abuela died, I found myself thinking back to the statue of Santa Bárbara, a mother figure watching over me as my abuela always had. I was overwhelmed by memories of her in the townhouse, sitting on the couch and talking on the phone next to the Santa Bárbara statue. When I moved to Brooklyn, I bought this small Santa Bárbara candle at a bodega as a small reminder of my abuelita, y todo el amor que ella me dio.</p>

  <li><b><i>Siboney</i> sheet music</b></li>
  <br>

  <p>In middle school, I learned how to play piano from my friend. I practiced everyday for hours on my small cheap keyboard, endlessly going over the basics, and I fell in love with music. The next year, the school music teacher put together a Hispanic Heritage concert and assigned me a part. She handed me the sheet music to <i><a href="https://dbpedia.org/page/Siboney_(song)">Siboney</a></i>, a Cuban song written by a Cuban man with large hands, and she sent me on my way. I didn’t have a piano teacher, and I’d only been playing piano for one year, and I found myself having to learn the most difficult piece of music I’d ever encountered. I spent weeks learning the part, with my small hands struggling to keep up. Eventually, after enough hours with the piece, it clicked. My fingers were dancing on the piano, and I was channeling my inner Ernesto Lecuona.</p>

  <p>Ernesto Lecuona wrote <i>Siboney</i> when he was away from Cuba to express his homesickness. I find myself homesick for Cuba, too. But I wonder how I can be homesick for somewhere that had never been my home. I’ve always been a hyphen, a Cuban-American, ni de aqui ni de allá. I was always a child in the Cuban diaspora, born away from my family's homeland. My whole life, I’ve been searching for the missing part of myself, the part my parents left behind in Cuba. And for a moment when playing <i>Siboney,</i> I found that missing piece.</p>

  <li><b>El paquete (cubano-americano version)</b></li>
  <br>

  <p>I made the pilgrimage back to Cuba in December 2019; I hadn’t been there since I was 7. There is very limited internet access on the island, and only for those that can afford it. The way Cubans get their popular media is through <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/07/inside-cubas-diy-internet-revolution/">El Paquete Semanal</a>, a collection of digital media that is distributed weekly on the underground market. As my cousin described it, a man comes by the barrio, you give him un peso and your USB drive or harddrive, and he gives it back to you a few days later with the latest movies, music, TV shows, animes, APK files, and videos. I got to see one in real life, it’s very comprehensive.</p>

  <p>For a time capsule, I would make my own paquete filled with the entire collection of <i><a href="https://www.quepasausa.org/">¿Qué Pasa, USA?</a></i> episodes. I used to watch reruns of the bilingual comedy, featuring a Cuban-American family in Miami in the 1980s, with my dad on our local PBS TV station. It was clever, funny, and real. It was the first and only piece of media I’d ever seen that told my story as a Cuban-American.</p>
  
  <li><b>Quinceañera y amor</b></li>

  <p>When I went back to Cuba, my cousin took me to la <a href="https://time.com/collection/worlds-greatest-places-2019/5654125/fabrica-de-arte-cubano-havana-cuba/">Fabrica de Arte</a>. Going there was among the highlights of my trip. I saw beautiful, thought provoking art made by mi gente, something I’d never imagined or seen before in the States. Two pieces of art struck me: one exhibit featuring various people's quinceañera photos, contrasted with their photos nowadays (titled <a href="https://www.museodelasmujeres.co.cr/exposiciones/de-ritos-y-otras-historias-por-yanahara-mauri-villarreal">De ritos y otras Historias" by Yanahara Mauri</a>), and a framed picture of two women kissing (titled <a href="https://www.enriquerottenberg.com/utopia">“Historia de un Beso” by Enrique Rottenberg</a>). For the first time in my life, I saw my queerness and latinidad together, as two symbiotic parts of my identity.</p>

  <p>Inspired by these two works, for the last object in my time capsule, I’d put a photo of me at my quinceañera on one side with a photo of <a href="https://hzylbolivar.com/">my wife</a> and I kissing on the other side. It’s the rites and rituals of my latinidad, the past of traditions, and the queer love I have now.</p>

</ol>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>I wanted to create a story with this time cpasule centered on my identity as a Cuban-American. I felt this project lended itself well to having my very personal stories around theses personal objects, with a theme. I think a lot of people can relate to objects capturing parts of your cultural identity, and I wanted to highlight that with the objects I chose.</p>

<p>I wrote down some inital ideas for objects in my phone notes, until I settled on the final five.</p>

<h2>Social media - Instagram</h2>

<p>I thought of this project as a potential art piece, so I posted all the objects on my art Instagram to share the images and stories around them with everyone! Instagram is the perfect place to share my art in a public forum, since it allows for multiple photo uploads and hashtags to find your work easily. I added hashtags to my time capsule project posts, so I can find them all in one place. I found it a very fitting platform for this art project!</p>

<p>You can find these objects posted on my art instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/undenailable.art/">here</a>!</p>
