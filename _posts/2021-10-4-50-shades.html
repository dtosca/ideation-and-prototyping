<p>Growing up, I always had a Rubik's Cube lying around the house. I found it to be a marvelous puzzle, simple and complex. Even my dad (the smartest man in the world) couldn't figure out it's mysteries! It wasn't until I met my wife, a Rubik’s cube enthusiast, that I started to uncover the secrets of the cube. Learning the algorithms to solve the cube is a deceptively simple process, but the math behind the solutions are complex.</p>

<p>In making the fifty renderings of the cube, I realized the drawings involved the same deceptively simple process as solving it.</p>

<p>It’s a straightforward figure: one cube, six faces, nine squares in each face, and twelve edges. Except I learned how hard it was to perfectly capture its simplicity. </p>

<p>Drawing a straight line is difficult, the angles and edges are hard to get just right. My hand and my eyes don’t seem to want to cooperate!</p>

<p>I had to let go of the perfection that I was striving for when making sketches. Instead, I should appreciate the process.</p>

<p>I usually get very frustrated working with markers. But this cube had so much personality, and I think the marker medium added to the boldness of it.</p>

<p>This was my first time working with charcoal and I absolutely loved it! It was so smooth and blendable. I'll cerntainly be exploring this medium again.</p>

<p>I loved working with paper to make this origami cube. It felt so sturdy and I loved the end result!</p>

<p>I didn't think I'd be able to make such a beautiful cube in 3D Microsoft Paint, but it is <b>perfect</b>.</p>
